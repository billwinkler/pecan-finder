# pecan-finder

A test of the Google Cloud Vision object localizer API to
see if it might be able to detect pecans.

See <https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/object-localizer>

## Install
Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [pecan-finder "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

## Credentials

Follow link to set up credentials, billing, etc...

<https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup>

You'll need credentials to make api calls. These can be specified via
an environment variable where `[PATH]` is the path to the json
credentials for a particular google project.  This is the project
where any charges will be accounted for.

``` shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"
```

Note, in MacOS, the export command needs to be invoked from zsh.
Place the `export` command in a `~/.zshenv`.  Invoke using `source`.

``` shell
source ~/.zshenv
```

## Usage

``` clojure
(annotate-image-as-maps "20200901_120343.JPG")
(annotate-image-with-crop-hints "20200901_120343.JPG")
(annotate-image-with-obj-localization "20200901_120343.JPG")

```

## Annotation Test Results

About half of the pecans (52%) were annotated as something.  Of those annotations, 98% were labeled as "Animal".  But other things, like leaves, sticks and branches were also identified as being "Animal[s]".  About one third of the objects annotated as "Animal" were pecans.
