## Credentials

Follow link to set up credentials, billing, etc...

You'll need credentials to make api calls. These can be specified via
an environment variable where `[PATH]` is the path to the json
credentials for a particular google project.  This is the project
where any charges will be accounted for.

``` shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="[PATH]"
```

Note, in MacOS, the export command needs to be invoked from zsh.
Place the `export` command in a `~/.zshenv`.  Invoke using `source`.

``` shell
source ~/.zshenv
```
